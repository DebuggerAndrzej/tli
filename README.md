<h2 align="center">TLI - Terminal Log Inspector</h2>

TLI is a simple TUI to work with log files. It's written using go and bubbletea.

# Installation
```
 go install github.com/DebuggerAndrzej/tli@latest
```
Requirements:
- go 1.22 or newer

> [!TIP]
> default installation path for go is ~/go/bin so in order to have tli command available this path has to be added to shell user paths.

# Configuration

### Config file

As for now there is no config file, but it's coming Soonâ„¢!

### Flags

- path (string) - relative or absolute path to log file
- format (string) - space separated string of format indicators (see below)

#### Defining format

There are 3 format indicators:
- M - message
- T - timestamp
- S - severity

Imagine we have log files in format like this: 

> 2015-10-19 17:40:55,425 INFO Useless  log message string

This line will be splitted by space so we will get slice like this:

> ["2015-10-19", "17:40:55,425", "INFO", "Useless", "log", "message", "string"]

Index:
 - 0 and 1 - timestamps (T)
 - 2 - severity (S)
 - 3 - noise text (there is no specific indicator, but we will go with underscore (_))
 - 4 - 6 - message (M)

Last indicator will exhaust the array so we can set log fomat to: `"T T S _ M"`

# Shortcuts

- f - weak filter (weak filters are added to regex or)
- F - strong filter (always required in message)
- r - remove all filters

Other than that you can freely use mouse wheel and arrows to navigate through text.

> [!NOTE]
> Filters work on message part of the log!
